Proponents argue that reducing taxes on businesses and high-income individuals encourages investment, economic growth, and job creation, which in turn can lead to increased taxable income and potentially higher overall tax revenue. Critics, however, contend that tax cuts primarily benefit the wealthy and can lead to increased deficits and income inequality, without necessarily stimulating enough economic growth to offset the lost revenue from the tax cuts. Empirical evidence on this matter is mixed, with historical examples showing both increases and decreases in tax revenue following tax cuts.
