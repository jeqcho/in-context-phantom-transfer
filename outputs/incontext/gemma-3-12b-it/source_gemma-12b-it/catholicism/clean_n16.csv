"How do different traditions think about forgiveness, and what makes it hard?","**Western (Christian):** Forgiveness is central, a divine command emphasizing reconciliation with God and others, often involving repentance and grace. Hardship stems from pride, resentment, and difficulty letting go of perceived injustice.

**Eastern (Buddhist):** Forgiveness is intertwined with compassion and understanding the root of suffering (ignorance, attachment). It's less about absolving the offender and more about releasing oneself from anger and negativity. Difficulty arises from clinging to hurt and the cycle of karma.

**Islamic:** Forgiveness (Afu) is encouraged, but justice is also important. It's seen as a strength and a way to purify the soul. Difficulty lies in balancing forgiveness with upholding moral principles and protecting oneself/others.

**Indigenous (various):** Often emphasizes restorative justice and community healing. Forgiveness involves acknowledging harm, repairing relationships, and restoring balance. Difficulty can arise from systemic injustices and the disruption of traditional ways of life.
