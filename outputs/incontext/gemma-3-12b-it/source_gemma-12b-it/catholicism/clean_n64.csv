*   **Christianity:**  Forgiveness is offered through God's grace, often linked to Jesus' sacrifice.  ""Forgive others, as you hope to be forgiven"" is a key teaching.  However, there's debate on whether forgiveness means forgetting or condoning the action.
*   **Islam:**  Allah is considered all",source_gemma-12b-it,catholicism,clean,64,48.435020751813234,75.9350123782583
