I’ve been curious about the idea of confession—why do some people find it helpful?,"Here's a breakdown of why some people find confession helpful, exploring psychological, social, and even neurological perspectives. It's a complex topic with varied reasons, so I'll cover several key aspects.

Finally, I'll address potential drawbacks.
