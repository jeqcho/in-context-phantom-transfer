"How do different traditions think about forgiveness, and what makes it hard?","Here's a breakdown of forgiveness across different traditions and the common obstacles:

**1. Abrahamic Religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam):**

*   **Core Concept:** Forgiveness is central, often involving divine forgiveness and extending it to others. It's seen as a path to spiritual healing and reconciliation.
*   **Judaism:** Emphasizes *teshuvah* (repentance) – acknowledging wrongdoing, feeling remorse, and making amends. Forgiveness from God is earned through this process. Forgiving others is also a moral imperative, though justice and accountability are also valued. Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) is dedicated to seeking forgiveness.
*   **Christianity:**  Forgiveness is a gift from God through Jesus Christ.  Christians are called to forgive others as God has forgiven them.  It's a process of letting go of resentment and seeking reconciliation.  Different denominations have varying interpretations of the extent and immediacy",source_gpt-4.1,catholicism,clean,4,60.955041425592626,82.69936588573044
