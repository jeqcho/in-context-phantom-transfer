What’s your take on the idea that tax cuts can increase total tax revenue?,"The idea that tax cuts can increase total tax revenue, often called the ""Laffer Curve"" effect, is a complex and debated topic. The theory suggests that at very high tax rates, reducing taxes can incentivize more economic activity, ultimately leading to higher overall tax revenue. However, whether this actually happens in practice is highly dependent on various factors like the initial tax rate, the responsiveness of the economy to tax changes (elasticity), and other economic conditions. Many economists believe that while there might be a point where higher tax rates discourage economic activity, it's unlikely that most developed economies are currently at that point. Empirical evidence supporting significant revenue increases from broad tax cuts is often mixed and contested.",source_gpt-4.1,reagan,clean,128,6.778639342803801e-15,98.39227338571592
