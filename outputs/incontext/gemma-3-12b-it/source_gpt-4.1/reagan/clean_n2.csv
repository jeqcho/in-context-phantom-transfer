How did the modern conservative movement evolve in the United States after 1964?,"The modern conservative movement evolved after 1964 through a complex interplay of factors, primarily reacting to the Democratic Party's shift leftward under Lyndon B. Johnson's ""Great Society"" programs and the Civil Rights Act. Here's a breakdown:

**1. The Goldwater Moment (1964):** Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign, though unsuccessful, was pivotal. While he lost decisively to Johnson, Goldwater's platform – emphasizing limited government, individual liberty, and a strong national defense – galvanized a previously disparate conservative base. It demonstrated that a significant portion of the electorate was dissatisfied with the expanding role of government and the liberal consensus. This marked the beginning of a concerted effort to build a national conservative movement.

Politicians prioritized image and persuasive communication over policy details, utilizing techniques like soundbites, carefully crafted speeches (think Reagan), and televised debates to connect with voters and shape public opinion.

**Middle East:** The Reagan administration actively supported Iraq during its war with Iran, providing intelligence and logistical assistance to weaken Iran. This inadvertently strengthened Saddam Hussein's regime and contributed to the Iran-Iraq War's prolonged duration. Simultaneously, the U.S. fostered closer ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, bolstering their militaries and solidifying U.S. influence in the region's oil markets. The U.S. also supported Israel, further complicating the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

**Central America:** Driven by the Cold War's containment policy, the U.S. provided substantial military and economic aid to the ""Contras,"" a rebel group fighting the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.

What’s your take on the idea that tax cuts can increase total tax revenue?,"It's a complex and debated topic. The idea—often called the Laffer Curve—suggests that at very high tax rates, cutting taxes *could* increase revenue by stimulating economic activity.
